Ingredients:
 - 175g packet plain tortilla chips
 - 225g jar salsa
 - a few sliced spring onions
 - a good chunk of cheese
 - a pinch of crushed chilli flakes
 - soured cream or guacamole (optional)

Directions:
 1. Tip tortilla chips on to a baking tray, pour over salsa and scatter over a few sliced spring onions.
